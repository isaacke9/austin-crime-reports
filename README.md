Description: Time series analysis on police crime reports in Austin.  

## Goal of Project
Our focus for this project is to explore any trends or cycles in Austinâ€™s crime rate and identify any crime
specific patterns (e.g. the relationship between time of year and crime count). Using that information we will
utilize various time series analysis techniques to smooth the data to uncover trend and seasonality, transform
to stationarity, generate ACF and PACF plots, formulate appropriate ARMA/SARIMA models, iteratively fit
and tune the models, and then forecast future crime rates in Austin.

## Data Introduction
The data was obtained from the Austin Police Department (APD). It includes all instances since January 1,
2003 where APD responded to a criminal incident and wrote a police report. Each entry includes the date
of the incident, the highest offense, whether it involved family violence, clearance status, clearance date, and
various spatial data such as GPS coordinates and council district. The dataset has been updated every Monday
since January 1, 2003 and at the time of writing was last updated June 6, 2022. For our particular aims of our
project, we specifically look at the count of the monthly police reports from January 2003 to March 2022 (231
observations).  

The initial time series plot (figure 1) of the data shows a few things. First, there is a cyclic annual seasonality;
each year the crime rates rise and fall in a similar pattern. Second, the time series is highly volatile. Within
a year, the number of crime rates fluctuate a lot. Third, there are some spikes of very high or low numbers of
police reports on some days, potentially indicating high variability. Finally, there is an initial increasing trend
until 2008, and then the total number of police reports begins gradually decreasing to present day.
